# ColourScales

ColourScales is a utility tool to quickly create a colour scale based on a range of numbers. It is used to generate colours primarily for visualis outputs such as maps and other charts. ColourScales was created by [MediaHack](https://mediahack.co.za).

ColourScales is currently built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Chroma.js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js).
